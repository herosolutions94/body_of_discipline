                In your first consultation with one of our Board Certified
                Urologists, we meticulously evaluate the advantages and
                potential risks associated with Testosterone Replacement Therapy
                (TRT). We verify the diagnosis of Low T, delve into your medical
                history, and thoroughly examine your laboratory findings. Our
                objective is to comprehensively investigate the underlying
                reasons for your low testosterone levels, enabling us to craft a
                treatment protocol tailored for superior results.
