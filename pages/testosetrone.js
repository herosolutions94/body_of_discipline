              <h2>What is Testosterone Therapy?</h2>
              <p>
                As men age, testosterone levels naturally decline, which can
                lead to reduced energy, decreased libido, mood swings, and more.
                Testosterone therapy is a safe, effective way to restore
                balance, helping you regain control over your health and
                lifestyle.

            <h2>10% OF MEN AFTER AGE 30 HAVE LOW Testosterone</h2>
            <p>
              As men grow older, their serum testosterone levels tend to
              diminish. In fact, once they reach the age of 30, it’s common for
              a man’s testosterone levels to decrease by approximately 1%
              annually. Low Testosterone, often referred to as hypogonadism,
              testosterone deficiency, male climacteric, or Low-T, is
              characterized by having a serum testosterone level below 300
              ng/dL, accompanied by associated symptoms. It’s worth noting that
              Low-T can pose potential risks for cardiovascular disease and
              prostate-related concerns. Symptoms of Low-T include weight gain,
              daily fatigue, loss of muscle mass (sarcopenia), lack of energy or
              endurance to perform tasks, taking daily naps after work or meals,
              loss of sex drive, weight gain, depression, poor cognition, and
              erectile dysfunction.
